Jenkins creation took reference from - https://www.coachdevops.com/search?q=jenkins+on+server



If your terminal is prometing all the path of the folders update the PS1 value in the ~/.bashrc file to update it to only current directory.
 vi ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Connect the ec2 instance   
ssh -i "mykey_feb14.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-126-14-66.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

You need to be in the folder where the access key is downloded to use the above command else you can just provide the path to it

update the instance packages 
sudo apt update

install JDK
sudo apt install default-jdk -y

Adding Repository  and jenkins installation - 
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

if you are facing issue you need to verify what jdk you are using and if needed you can change the jdk by using below command 
java --version 

if its below jdk 11 change it by below command 
sudo update-alternatives --config java

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are multiple groups available you can list them using 
cat /etc/group

if you want to create a user provide system access to the user you can add the user to the particular group 

Here EC2 is a ubuntu user and can't perform jenkins system restart as it is not having root permission or system permissions here system means jenkins 
Add the ubuntu user to jenkins groups to have admin access to only jenkins system

Create a New User
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash <username>
-m → Creates a home directory (/home/<username>)
-s /bin/bash → Sets the default shell to Bash

Set a password for the user:
sudo passwd <username>

Check if the group exists:
getent group <groupname>

If it does not exist, create it:
sudo groupadd <groupname>

Add the User to the Group
sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>

Verify the User’s Group Membership
groups <username>

if the jenkins UI is not acccessible make sure the http port is stated in the jenkins file 
sudo vi /etc/default/jenkins

Add the below content and restart the jenkins server
HTTP_PORT=8080
JENKINS_ARGS="--httpListenAddress=0.0.0.0"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 2 servers a,b is run ssh-keygen it creates public and private keys in the ~/.ssh location 
id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub 

now we need to copy the pub file and copy that in the sudo -u jenkins vi /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys file in the b server here we create jenkins server before hand.
now if we try ssh from a to be using ssh jenkins@slave_node_ip which is server b a new file know_host is created in ~/.ssh location this contains the host-key os b which helps in identifying the server b in future conections and avoid man in the middle attack.
Man in middle attack is if you are looking to ssh from a to b a imposter interfers and acts as b and gathers all the inforamtion to avoid it it validates the host key of b in the know host file.

Host keys are different from user keys ie user keys are priavte/public keys created by ssh-keygen which are used for password less authentication and file transfer and host keys are used to uniquely identify the server.
